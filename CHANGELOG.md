# Changelog

All notable changes to **vellum** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Login now survives a page refresh.** The session token is kept in
  sessionStorage (restored on load and verified), so reloading no longer drops
  you back to the connect screen.

### Added
- **Delete folders** — hover a folder in the tree for a `×`; a confirm dialog
  shows how many notes go with it, then it's removed recursively
  (`DELETE /api/folders/{path}`).
- **Re-scan vault** button in the tree header — pulls in notes added/changed
  via MCP without a full page reload.
- **Loading feedback** — a spinner while a note opens, a top progress bar when
  switching notes, and a "Searching…" indicator in the command palette.
- **MCP server icon** — the folded-leaf mark is advertised in the MCP server
  info (`icons` data URI + `websiteUrl`) and served at `/favicon.ico`, so the
  server shows an icon in the Inspector and connector lists.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **MCP clients can finally connect.** Implemented OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
  Registration (RFC 7591): a `POST /register` endpoint, `registration_endpoint`
  in the discovery metadata, and public (PKCE-only, no client secret)
  authorization-code / refresh flows. Previously vellum only accepted the fixed
  confidential client and demanded the shared secret on every grant, so the MCP
  Inspector, claude.ai, Cursor, etc. could not authenticate at all. Verified
  end-to-end via the MCP Inspector over HTTP (register → authorize → token →
  list/read/write tools).

### Added
- **Sentry error reporting** (`getsentry/sentry-go`), off unless `SENTRY_DSN`
  is set. Panics and internal 5xx are captured and also recorded as error
  events in the workspace **Activity** panel. See `docs/observability.md`.
- **Activity & errors** panel: an error-count badge on the activity button, an
  **Errors** filter, a search box, and expandable error rows (level, tool,
  status, message) with *Export → JSON* and *Fix with Claude Code*.
- **MCP Inspector** dev tasks: `task inspector` (stdio) and `task inspector-http`
  (Streamable HTTP), UI at `http://localhost:6274`.

### Changed
- `.env.example` documents the SMTP digest and Sentry settings.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Redesigned connect / login screen** (design artboard 1a): a two-column card
  with sign-in on the left and a full "Connect a client" guide on the right —
  copyable endpoint, a four-step Claude.ai walkthrough, and tabs with ready-to-
  paste config for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT and Cursor.

### Changed
- The SMTP digest now also sends once shortly after start (to confirm the setup)
  in addition to the recurring interval.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-04

Synced from the updated Claude Design "Vellum Workspace" project.

### Added
- **MCP connections panel** — a live drawer of connected clients (name, kind,
  session id, uptime, last tool, call count) with a **Revoke** action, backed
  by in-memory session tracking on the server. A top-bar pill shows the active
  count.
- **Activity / curator log** — a right-hand drawer with a live timeline of what
  MCP clients and the curator did to the vault, an **All / Curator / MCP**
  filter, a curator status card and a **Run now** action.
- **Notifications** — a bell with an unread dot and a popover of derived
  notifications (untagged notes, stale inbox, open tasks, new sessions), with
  *mark all read* and dismiss.
- **Create folder** — a ＋ button in the tree opens an inline input; the folder
  is persisted (`POST /api/folders`) and nests under the selected folder.
- **GitHub Star button** in the top bar with a best-effort live star count.
- **SMTP digest** — an optional periodic e-mail of open tasks
  (`VELLUM_NOTIFY=on` + `SMTP_*`).
- **Guided tour** gains steps for the new folder, notifications, activity and
  star controls and is now fully keyboard-driven (**← / →**, Esc to skip).
- Help modal gains a **Connect a client** section (endpoint + CLI, both with
  copy buttons).
- New REST endpoints: `GET /api/connections` (+ `DELETE` to revoke),
  `GET /api/activity`, `GET /api/notifications`, `POST /api/curator/run`,
  `GET`/`POST /api/folders`.
- Icon set gains `bell`, `activity`, `sparkle` and a filled GitHub mark.

### Changed
- The list view hides the status segmented control for Knowledge notes.
- Tree folder badges show `matching / total` (e.g. `1/6`) while a tag filter is
  active; empty folders now appear in the tree.
- The MCP request path records per-tool activity and touches a session so the
  Connections and Activity panels reflect real usage.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Markdown editor helper** — a formatting toolbar (bold, italic, H1/H2,
  bullet list, checkbox, quote, inline code, `[[wikilink]]`) that operates on
  the selection, `⌘B` / `⌘I` shortcuts, and a live word count.
- **Clickable checkboxes** in the preview toggle `- [ ]` ↔ `- [x]` and save.
- **Move / rename / delete** from the editor — a *Move to…* folder popover,
  a rename field, drag-and-drop of a note onto a tree folder, and a delete
  button with a confirmation dialog.
- **Task status dropdown** — change `backlog` / `in-progress` / `done`
  straight from the editor header.
- **Help modal** with a markdown cheatsheet, keyboard shortcuts and the
  note-type legend, plus a **guided onboarding tour** (shown once, remembered
  in `localStorage`).
- **Toasts** for move / delete / status feedback and a **Saved ✓ / Saving…**
  indicator in the status bar.
- **SVG icon set** replacing text glyphs across the workspace (fixes
  missing-glyph "tofu" boxes on some platforms).

### Changed
- Top bar splits theme, help and settings into separate controls; tree
  groups are collapsible.
- `design/Vellum-Workspace.dc.html` re-synced from the Claude Design project
  (adds the interactions above).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Connect screen key icon rendered as a missing-glyph box (`⚿`, U+26BF) on
  macOS — replaced with an inline SVG key.

### Added
- README author section, badges (release, CI, Go, license, GHCR) and GitHub
  topics for discoverability.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-04

First stable release.

### Added
- Self-hosted MCP server over a folder of markdown: 15 tools (+6 optional
  curator tools behind `VELLUM_CURATOR=on`).
- OAuth 2.1 (authorization code + PKCE, client credentials) with vellum as
  its own issuer; opaque in-memory tokens.
- Embedded React workspace UI served from the single Go binary.
- Launch documentation, version manifests, deployment + smoke-test checklist.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- REST API (`/api/*`) with sha256 ETag / `If-Match` → `409` optimistic
  concurrency.
- Workspace SPA — three-pane tree / list / editor, command palette, filters.
- SPA embedded into the binary behind the `embedspa` build tag (`go build`
  stays node-free); ~24 MB image, ~5 MiB idle RAM.
- Fixture vault and end-to-end checklist (`task e2e`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- Vault layer: CRUD, atomic writes, path-traversal protection, in-memory
  metadata index (tags, backlinks, task states), parallel-scan search.
- Task frontmatter (`type: task | knowledge`, `status`), tags, curator
  suggestions.
- MCP tool surface over Streamable HTTP; OAuth model.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- Walking skeleton: `/healthz`, distroless Docker image + compose, GitHub
  Actions CI and multi-arch release to GHCR, Taskfile.
